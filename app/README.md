## With whom did you do the task?
I did it myself with the help of tutorial on the first synchronous session with Mr. Adin
## How did you do the task?
I already installed Android Studio since a year and a half ago, so I didn't quite remember how did I do the installation part. But for the project itself, I just clicked the option 'New Project' and chose the Basic Activity template. I also changed the text from the existing template to 'Hello World' at the strings.xml
## Why did you do the task the way you do?
I chose to use Kotlin because I read from an article that Android Development in the future will mostly use Kotlin instead of Java. I didn't build from the Basic Activity because right now I'm interested to know about the default Android Native project structure and how they all got connected. I read [this tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/android/index.htm) as I go through all the files in the default project structure to see the connection between them all. I learnt about the purposes of every folder in the /res folder, what AndroidManifest.xml about and what inside it, and the application life cycle. As I learnt, I tried to do a little modification on the text content to change it to Hello World.
